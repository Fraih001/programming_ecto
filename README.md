Chapter 1

++ All communication to and from the database goes through Repo.  
++ mix ecto.reset will drop the database, re-create it, and repopulate it with the original sample data.  
++ If you want to talk to your databae, you to the the Repository (Repo module)  
++ set option (Repo.update_all("artists", set: [updated_at: DateTime.utc_now()])) tells Ecto what fields to change for all entries  
++ the standard return value for all ??\_all functions is a tuple where the first item is the number of records affected by the operation. The second contains the values we asked to be returned. - Repo.insert_all("artists", [%{name: "Max Roach"}, %{name: "Art Blakey"}], returning: [:id, :name]) <- will return the id + name of the two records changed as the second item.  
++ Can use raw SQL with Repo.query - ex: Repo.query("select \* from artists where id=1")

Chapter 2

++ Ecto provides two different synta: macro (pipe operator) and keyword  
++ Macro (like the Ecto.Query.from function) is code that writes code  
++ When using prefixes in your database, you can specify them by using the prefix keyword  
++ Because Ecto's query syntax is implemented using macros, we need to use the pin operator (^) when using variables  
++ Ecto's Type function will convert a type for us (integer to string for example)  
++ Create a Query binding by using the 'in' keyword (from a in "artists", where: a.name == "Bill Evans", select...)  
++ Use the fragment keyword to inject raw SQL into a query (can also create macro if keyword is used often)  
++ The Union operator combines the results of different queries  
++ order_by and group_by keywords are available in Ecto  
++ Give thought to columns that might contain null by using :asc_nulls_last, :asc_nulls_first  
++ the having clause will take results of query and further refine them  
++ when using the select keyword, you can provide a map for a more expressive return statement  
++ When composing queries, binding order is preserverd  
++ To create named bindings, you use the keyword 'as: ' and it must follow after from and/or join. You also must use an atom  
++ Named bindings can appear in any order after the from keyword  
++ use has_named_binding? function to determine whether query has a named binding  
++ use or macro in where keyword  
++ or_where macro works exactly like the where keyword but uses OR instead of the default AND operator

Chapter 3

++ Schema macro takes two args: name of table to map to and a block containing definitions for the fields to use  
++ The schema does not have to match 1 to 1 w/ the columns in database table, only those fields we plan to use in our code  
++ timestamp macro adds two fields to schema - inserted_at, updated_at <- these fields must be found within the table for this to work properly  
++ By default, Ecto will create id field for you  
++ Integrating a schema into the query performs type conversions for us, allows us to remove the select option and returns a schema struct  
++ In Ecto, relationships between DB tables are referred to as associations  
++ For nested associations, use the through: option  
++ For many-to-many associations, use the join_through: option. If you only need foreign keys in the relationship table, then you do not need to create a schema. However, if you need other keys in that table besides the foreign keys (timestamps, etc), then you'll need to create a schema  
++ Due to Ecto not having "lazy loading," you can use the preload function if you want to load any associations within a given query (grabbing all albums then preloading tracks for albums for example)  
++ on_delete option provides a way to delete child records when a parent record has been deleted (:nothing, :nilify_all, :delete_all are different options to pass)

Chapter 4

++ First step in creating a changeset is taking the raw input data and generating an Ecto.Changeset struct.  
++ Casting and filtering is when we perform any needed type casting operations (changing a string to an integer) and then filter our any values we don't need.  
++ If the data is internal (the app is generating it), then we can create a changeset using the change function. (ex: changeset = change(%Artist{name: "Charlie Parker"}))  
++ To make changes to an existing record, we use a record fetched from Repo (Repo.get_by(data) -> change(data))  
++ To see the changes that are going to applied, check the changes field (ex: changeset.changes)  
++ We can update a changeset instead of creating a new one (ex: changeset = change(changeset, birth_date: ~D[1941-01-27])) or you can add multiple arguments to the change function (ex: changeset = change(artist, name: "Robert Hutcherson",
birth_date: ~D[1941-01-27]))  
++ the cast function is similar to change as it returns a changeset  
++ the cast function takes three arguments  
first arg: new schema struct, a fetched record, or another changeset  
second arg: raw data to be applied  
third arg: list of params allowed in the changeset, anything not listed will be discarded  
++ you can pass an empty_values option to the changeset to change the string NULL for example to an empty value  
++ Validations and constraints check the integrity of our data  
++ the validate_change function is a way to create custom validations by passing an anonymous function to perform whatever check you need.  
++ it's smart to move your custom validations to separate function, makes it easier to read  
++ Constraints are enforced by the database, will not see an error until the databasse is interacted with  
++ the unsafe_validate_unique function is a hybrid between a vliadation and a constraint  
++ To set up a changeset to work without a schema, you must first define a map where the keys are the keys of the changeset and the values are the data types

Chapter 5

++ Transactions allow you to group operations together so you can be certain that they will all succeed, or all fail.  
++ Ecto supports transactions through the Repo.transaction function.  
You can execute this function in two ways. The first way is to provide another function that contains the operations youâ€™d like to execute. The second way is to use Ecto.Multi, a data structure consisting of a queue of operations to be run within a transaction.  
++ Must use bang (!) after database call to ensure error is raised by transaction function and rollback occurs  
If you didn't want to use a bang, then you can use the rollback function explicitly  
++ When using the transaction button, you want to execute database operations first before any non-database functions
