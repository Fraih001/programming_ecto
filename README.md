PART 1  
  
Chapter 1  
  
++ All communication to and from the database goes through Repo.  
++ mix ecto.reset will drop the database, re-create it, and repopulate it with the original sample data.  
++ If you want to talk to your databae, you to the the Repository (Repo module)  
++ set option (Repo.update_all("artists", set: [updated_at: DateTime.utc_now()])) tells Ecto what fields to change for all entries  
++ the standard return value for all ??\_all functions is a tuple where the first item is the number of records affected by the operation. The second contains the values we asked to be returned. - Repo.insert_all("artists", [%{name: "Max Roach"}, %{name: "Art Blakey"}], returning: [:id, :name]) <- will return the id + name of the two records changed as the second item.  
++ Can use raw SQL with Repo.query - ex: Repo.query("select \* from artists where id=1")

Chapter 2

++ Ecto provides two different synta: macro (pipe operator) and keyword  
++ Macro (like the Ecto.Query.from function) is code that writes code  
++ When using prefixes in your database, you can specify them by using the prefix keyword  
++ Because Ecto's query syntax is implemented using macros, we need to use the pin operator (^) when using variables  
++ Ecto's Type function will convert a type for us (integer to string for example)  
++ Create a Query binding by using the 'in' keyword (from a in "artists", where: a.name == "Bill Evans", select...)  
++ Use the fragment keyword to inject raw SQL into a query (can also create macro if keyword is used often)  
++ The Union operator combines the results of different queries  
++ order_by and group_by keywords are available in Ecto  
++ Give thought to columns that might contain null by using :asc_nulls_last, :asc_nulls_first  
++ the having clause will take results of query and further refine them  
++ when using the select keyword, you can provide a map for a more expressive return statement  
++ When composing queries, binding order is preserverd  
++ To create named bindings, you use the keyword 'as: ' and it must follow after from and/or join. You also must use an atom  
++ Named bindings can appear in any order after the from keyword  
++ use has_named_binding? function to determine whether query has a named binding  
++ use or macro in where keyword  
++ or_where macro works exactly like the where keyword but uses OR instead of the default AND operator

Chapter 3

++ Schema macro takes two args: name of table to map to and a block containing definitions for the fields to use  
++ The schema does not have to match 1 to 1 w/ the columns in database table, only those fields we plan to use in our code  
++ timestamp macro adds two fields to schema - inserted_at, updated_at <- these fields must be found within the table for this to work properly  
++ By default, Ecto will create id field for you  
++ Integrating a schema into the query performs type conversions for us, allows us to remove the select option and returns a schema struct  
++ In Ecto, relationships between DB tables are referred to as associations  
++ For nested associations, use the through: option  
++ For many-to-many associations, use the join_through: option. If you only need foreign keys in the relationship table, then you do not need to create a schema. However, if you need other keys in that table besides the foreign keys (timestamps, etc), then you'll need to create a schema  
++ Due to Ecto not having "lazy loading," you can use the preload function if you want to load any associations within a given query (grabbing all albums then preloading tracks for albums for example)  
++ on_delete option provides a way to delete child records when a parent record has been deleted (:nothing, :nilify_all, :delete_all are different options to pass)

Chapter 4

++ First step in creating a changeset is taking the raw input data and generating an Ecto.Changeset struct.  
++ Casting and filtering is when we perform any needed type casting operations (changing a string to an integer) and then filter our any values we don't need.  
++ If the data is internal (the app is generating it), then we can create a changeset using the change function. (ex: changeset = change(%Artist{name: "Charlie Parker"}))  
++ To make changes to an existing record, we use a record fetched from Repo (Repo.get_by(data) -> change(data))  
++ To see the changes that are going to applied, check the changes field (ex: changeset.changes)  
++ We can update a changeset instead of creating a new one (ex: changeset = change(changeset, birth_date: ~D[1941-01-27])) or you can add multiple arguments to the change function (ex: changeset = change(artist, name: "Robert Hutcherson",
birth_date: ~D[1941-01-27]))  
++ the cast function is similar to change as it returns a changeset  
++ the cast function takes three arguments  
first arg: new schema struct, a fetched record, or another changeset  
second arg: raw data to be applied  
third arg: list of params allowed in the changeset, anything not listed will be discarded  
++ you can pass an empty_values option to the changeset to change the string NULL for example to an empty value  
++ Validations and constraints check the integrity of our data  
++ the validate_change function is a way to create custom validations by passing an anonymous function to perform whatever check you need.  
++ it's smart to move your custom validations to separate function, makes it easier to read  
++ Constraints are enforced by the database, will not see an error until the databasse is interacted with  
++ the unsafe_validate_unique function is a hybrid between a vliadation and a constraint  
++ To set up a changeset to work without a schema, you must first define a map where the keys are the keys of the changeset and the values are the data types

Chapter 5

++ Transactions allow you to group operations together so you can be certain that they will all succeed, or all fail.  
++ Ecto supports transactions through the Repo.transaction function.  
You can execute this function in two ways. The first way is to provide another function that contains the operations youâ€™d like to execute. The second way is to use Ecto.Multi, a data structure consisting of a queue of operations to be run within a transaction.  
++ Must use bang (!) after database call to ensure error is raised by transaction function and rollback occurs  
If you didn't want to use a bang, then you can use the rollback function explicitly  
++ When using the transaction button, you want to execute database operations first before any non-database functions  
++ Drawbacks to anon transation functions:  
+ One small error like forgetting a bang can have a big negative impact on db   
+ Anon functions are not composable, limiting their reusability  
+ Requires a lot of code to see errors  
++ Instead of using an anon function to use transactions, you can use Ecto.Multi  
++ Use the new keyword to create a new multi struct (Multi.new) instead of %Multi{}  
  
Chapter 6  
  
++ Ecto uses migrations to create and alter tables in the DB  
++ A migration is a set of commands, created in Elixir, that contains the instructions for the changes you want to make  
++ The easiest way to create a new migration is to use the mix task that Ecto provides: mix ecto.gen.migration.  
++ Ecto will always create a primary key column called id unless you instruct it not to  
++ mix.ecto.rollback allows you to rollback your last migration  
++ general rule: it's OK to edit an existing migration provided that you haven't already committed your migration to source control.  
++ Use index function to create indices for columns within a table  
++ When migrating data from one table to another, consider using the flush function as it tells Ecto to execute the currently queued operations (any code before the flush call)  
++ When making big changes to the db, write up and down functions so that Ecto can rollback changes effectively, usually the up function just being the change  function, then a separate down function to assist with rollback  
  
PART 2  
  
Chapter 7  
  
++ --sup flag when creating a new project adds Ecto to the supervision tree of the project  
  
Chapter 8  
  
++ Come back to this chapter if working with forms  
  
Chapter 9  
  
++ To use the testing sandbox, add "pool: Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox" to the Repo config file  
++ Then, need to set the correct ownership mode  
++ Ownership mode affects the way the sandbox interacts with different processes. The three modes are: :auto, :manual, :shared  
++ To work around limitations of shared mode (able to share processes but unable to run tests concurrently), Ecto provides allowances.  
  
Chapter 10  
  
++ In order to create a new type, based on an existing one, first need to create a module that implements the Ecto.Type behavior  
++ Within module, must create type, dump, load and cast functions  
++ To work with a data type not recognized in Ecto, need to write custom driver extension  
  
Chapter 11  
  
++ Upsert is a mash-up of update & insert  
++ Use on_conflict to make changes when using insert (:replace, :nothing, :raise - default)  
++ When using replace, it is a tuple {:replace, [:columns to replace]}  
++ Add conflict_target / returning keys to specificy exactly which column should be changed  
  
Chapter 12  
  
++ When testing to see whether a changeset is created correctly, use apply_changes() instead of calling the db. It is a much less expensive call.  
  
Chapter 13  
  
++ Embedded schema are an alternative to using regular associations.  
++ Embedded schema are captured in the same table as the parent schema, instead of a separate table  
  
Chapter 14  
  
++ Polymorphism isn't built out of the box in Ecto. Need to use one of three approaches outlined in the book.
