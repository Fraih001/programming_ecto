Chapter 1

++ All communication to and from the database goes through Repo.  
++ mix ecto.reset will drop the database, re-create it, and repopulate it with the original sample data.  
++ If you want to talk to your databae, you to the the Repository (Repo module)  
++ set option (Repo.update_all("artists", set: [updated_at: DateTime.utc_now()])) tells Ecto what fields to change for all entries  
++ the standard return value for all ??\_all functions is a tuple where the first item is the number of records affected by the operation. The second contains the values we asked to be returned. - Repo.insert_all("artists", [%{name: "Max Roach"}, %{name: "Art Blakey"}], returning: [:id, :name]) <- will return the id + name of the two records changed as the second item.  
++ Can use raw SQL with Repo.query - ex: Repo.query("select \* from artists where id=1")
